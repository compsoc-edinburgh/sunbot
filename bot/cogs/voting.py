üó≥ sunhacks uses comparison voting to determine our hackers' choice award! \
If you aren't familiar with comparison voting systems (like Gavel) please \
read the instructions below!

Comparison voting works by comparing two projects and picking which is better. \
We will send you one project at a time and you will have to compare this with \
the previous. You will use emoji reactions to vote on the better project.

If you are shown a project that you feel may have cheated, please use the üö© \
reaction to report it. This will give you a different project to compare with \
your previous project.

To begin, did you submit a project on Devpost? **React with üëç or üëé**
